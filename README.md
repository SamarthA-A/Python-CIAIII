## Student Performance Analysis using Generative AI
# Overview
This project aims to assess student performance based on their use of generative AI tools for completing assignments. The analysis focuses on key areas like critical thinking, problem-solving, and knowledge retention. Using Python and Streamlit, the project provides an interactive web application for visualizing and exploring insights derived from the data of 150 students.

# Features
- Data Collection and Preprocessing: Includes methods for handling and analyzing data collected from 150 students.
-- Performance Metrics: Evaluation of students across:
  * Critical Thinking
  * Problem-Solving
  * Knowledge Retention
- Interactive Dashboard: Built with Streamlit to provide:
- Visualizations of performance metrics
- Insights into the impact of generative AI on learning outcomes
- Customizable Analysis: Filter results by specific criteria such as grade levels, assignment types, or time spent using AI tools.

# Cloning the Repository
- git clone https://github.com/SamarthA-A/Python-CIAIII.git
- cd student-performance-analysis
  
# Required Libraries
- streamlit: For building the interactive web app
- pandas: For data manipulation
- matplotlib and seaborn: For visualizations
- numpy: For numerical operations

# Running the Application
To launch the Streamlit app, execute the following command:
```
- streamlit run app.py
```
This will open the application in your default web browser. If it doesn't, copy and paste the URL shown in the terminal into your browser.

# Usage
1. Upload Data: Upload the CSV file containing student data e.g., assignment scores, AI usage metrics.
2. Select Metrics: Choose the metrics you want to analyze e.g., critical thinking scores.
3. Filter Options: Use interactive widgets to filter by grade levels, time ranges, etc.
4. Visualize Insights: View dynamically generated charts and statistics.
